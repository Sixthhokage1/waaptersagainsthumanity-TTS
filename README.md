# Dafuq is this?
This is the source for a custom Cards Against Humanity pack in Tabletop Simulator. This pack is created by/for the [We Are All Pok√©mon Trainers](https://waapt.wiki.tropi.us/) community.

The deck PDFs are generated in [Bigger Blacker Cards](http://biggerblackercards.com/) and converted into individual image files in the White and Black directories with Ghostscript Studio. The images are imported into [Tabletop Simulator Deck Builder](http://www.nexusmods.com/tabletopsimulator/mods/61/?) (the TSDB files are the deck saves) and the exported card sheets are uploaded to Imgur and saved as a custom deck in TTS. The card backs were taken from [this mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330420001).

# Why are you putting this on GH?
So that I have it in version control in a central repo I can access from all my machines and if anyone from the community wants to take a stab at editing it then yay!
